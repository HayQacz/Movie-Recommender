    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "This notebook focuses on implementing and evaluating various recommendation algorithms. We will explore different approaches, from simple popularity-based recommendations to more sophisticated content-based and collaborative filtering methods. The goal is to understand their strengths and weaknesses and identify the most suitable model(s) for our system.\n",

    "## 2. Setup and Imports\n",
    "We'll import the necessary libraries, including pandas for data manipulation, numpy for numerical operations, scikit-learn for various ML utilities (e.g., pairwise.cosine_similarity, model_selection.train_test_split), and matplotlib/seaborn for visualization."
